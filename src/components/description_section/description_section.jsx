          <p className='description'>Recent <strong>University of California, San Diego</strong> graduate working as a web developer for 2 years. I am a front end developer focused on building beautiful and optimized applications. I love structure and order so I stand for elegant code. I love spending time on fixing little details and optimizing web apps. My passion is learning and using the most recent application frameworks to create scalable products for small companies looking to grow or large companies looking for better user experiences. I believe great user interfaces that understand human needs are the driving force of todayâ€™s successful businesses.</p>
